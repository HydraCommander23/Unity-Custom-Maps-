**Author:** HydraCommander23  
**Project Start:** August 2025

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project aims to recreate the unreleased maps **ENG_DryDock** and **ENG_Gravity_Anchor**, which were not included in the final release of Alien Isolation. Due to the absence of official files, development is based on limited concept art, reference screenshots, and speculations according to the Alien Isolation wiki page.

## ✅ Current Progress

- [x] Created this GitHub repository
- [x] Added all known reference images and concept art to the [README.md](./README.md)
- [x] Started analyzing map references and brainstorming possible layouts
- [ ] Identified visual and thematic elements tied to each map
