**Author:** HydraCommander23  
**Project Start:** August 2025  
**Status:** Early Planning Phase  
**Maps:** ENG_DryDock, ENG_Gravity_Anchor

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project aims to recreate the unreleased maps **ENG_DryDock** and **ENG_Gravity_Anchor**, which were not included in the final release of [REDACTED GAME]. Due to the absence of official files, development is based on limited concept art, reference screenshots, and community speculation.

## ✅ Current Progress

- [x] Created this GitHub repository
- [x] Added all known reference images and concept art to the [README.md](./README.md)
- [x] Started analyzing map references and brainstorming possible layouts
- [x] Identified visual and thematic elements tied to each map

## 🧠 Brainstorming Phase (In Progress)

| Task                                     | Status     |
|------------------------------------------|------------|
| Collect additional reference materials   | ⏳ Ongoing |
| Sketch top-down layouts from concept art | ⏳ Ongoing |
| Identify possible game modes for each map| ⏳ Ongoing |
| Note visual landmarks and vertical spaces| ⏳ Ongoing |

## 🔜 Upcoming Tasks

### Map Prototyping
- [ ] Begin whiteboxing **ENG_DryDock** layout in Unity (ProBuilder)
