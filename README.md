# Custom Unity Maps for *Alien: Isolation*

![header](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a797edf-8836-4f99-b4a4-1fd938bd1aa3)

- This repo contains my custom versions of unused or cut areas from *Alien: Isolation*, made in **Unity 2022.3.9f1**. The original game has many doors, elevators, and areas that you can't access — likely removed late in development.  
- My plan is to develop and recreate what the game might have played like if these areas were kept or added in.

## 📂 Areas Currently Being Envisioned
### 🔧 ENG_DryDock / ENG_DryDockCargo  
ENG_DryDock serves as a large engineering bay designed for docking and maintenance of incoming freighters and engineering modules on Sevastopol Station. It includes sealed airlocks, cargo lifts, mooring clamps, and support infrastructure for ship servicing. ENG_DryDockCargo functions as an adjacent freight handling zone, potentially integrating automated Working Joe systems for efficient cargo transport and inventory management.

### 🛰️ ENG_Gravity_Anchor  
ENG_Gravity_Anchor is an external engineering section focused on orbital stabilization systems critical to maintaining Sevastopol’s geosynchronous orbit. This zone includes stabilizer thrusters, anchoring mechanisms, exposed bulkheads, and access walkways. The environment is highly industrial and claustrophobic, with hazards such as vacuum exposure and system malfunctions posing risks to maintenance crews.

## 🔊 Audio Logs
These lore-inspired audio logs add depth and atmosphere to each environment.  
Each log starts with an ID tag and timestamp to enhance immersion.

### ENG_DryDock  
- [ENG_DD_214_Holding_Pattern.mp3](./audio/ENG_DD_214_Holding_Pattern.mp3)  
  *“Log ENG_DD_214. Recorded April 2nd, 2137.”*
  DryDock’s full again. Two haulers in, one waiting in orbit. We’ve still got crates stacked three-deep from the last loadout, 
and the cargo clamps are locking out at random. Maintenance flagged them last month. We put in for parts—standard Seegson delay. 
I told command we’d need a hard shutdown to cycle the clamps but got ignored, again. Can’t hold these ships much longer without 
risking structural integrity.

- [ENG_DD_218_Code_Blue.mp3](./audio/ENG_DD_218_Code_Blue.mp3)  
  *“Log ENG_DD_218. Recorded April 4th, 2137.”*
  I had a Working Joe override my airlock commands today. Just… overruled me mid-cycle. Said there was a cargo inspection priority 
from Seegson Core Control. But no log. No record. It vented the B-deck loader before the hauler even finished depressurizing. 
We lost two crates and damaged an actuator. These things aren’t just helping anymore. They’re interfering.
  
### ENG_DryDockCargo  
- [ENG_DDC_113_Ghost_Manifests.mp3](./audio/ENG_DDC_113_Ghost_Manifests.mp3)
  I’ve got manifests showing inbound loads that never arrived. One from the Magellan, says it dropped off med supplies and fusion seals. 
But they’re not in inventory. Not in the crate logs. Could be a dock error… or someone’s skimming off the top. I filed a report, 
but nobody’s looked at it. Station’s bleeding from every end and we’re worried about shipping paper trails.
 
- [ENG_DDC_117_Breaker_Box.mp3](./audio/ENG_DDC_117_Breaker_Box.mp3)
The cargo lift bucked again. Third time this week. It nearly crushed a Joe trying to move power cells. We’ve told Engineering it’s a breaker issue — 
too much drain when the upper decks pull reserve power. No response. They just keep rerouting juice through the same old panel. 
If we don’t shut that lift down, someone’s gonna get flattened.

### ENG_Gravity_Anchor  
- [ENG_GA_031_Orbital_Drift.mp3](./audio/ENG_GA_031_Orbital_Drift.mp3)
Anchor Stabilizer Array 3 is out of sync again. That’s the third time since the last solar pass. We’re pulling orbital telemetry from EarthGov, 
and Sevastopol is drifting—barely, but it’s enough to throw off targeting and nav syncing. If this station loses one more stabilizer, 
we won’t be able to hold a geosynchronous lock. No lock, no supply runs. No way back.

- [ENG_GA_036_Dead_Space.mp3](./audio/ENG_GA_036_Dead_Space.mp3)
I went EVA to resecure the anchor clamps. Half of them were blown out — like something ripped right through the external plating. 
I thought maybe a micro-meteoroid hit, but the punctures are too clean. And the anchoring gel had signs of chemical corrosion. 
Nobody’s saying it, but... something else is out here. I’m logging this in case I don’t make it back inside.
