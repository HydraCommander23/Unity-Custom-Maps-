# Custom Unity Maps for *Alien: Isolation*

![header](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a797edf-8836-4f99-b4a4-1fd938bd1aa3)

- This repo will contain my custom versions of unused or cut areas from *Alien: Isolation*, made in **Unity 2022.3.9f1**. The original game has many doors, elevators, and areas that you can't access — likely removed late in development.  
- My plan is to develop and recreate what the game might have played like if these areas were kept or added in.

## 📂 Areas Currently Being Envisioned

### 🔧 ENG_DryDock / ENG_DryDockCargo

**ENG_DryDock** serves as a large engineering bay designed for docking and maintenance of incoming freighters and engineering modules on Sevastopol Station. It includes sealed airlocks, cargo lifts, mooring clamps, and support infrastructure for ship servicing. 

**ENG_DryDockCargo** functions as an adjacent freight handling zone, potentially integrating automated Working Joe systems for efficient cargo transport and inventory management.

### 🛰️ ENG_Gravity_Anchor

**ENG_Gravity_Anchor** is an external engineering section dedicated to orbital stabilization systems that maintain Sevastopol Station’s geosynchronous orbit. The zone comprises stabilizer thrusters, anchoring mechanisms, exposed bulkheads, and access walkways. It is a highly industrial and claustrophobic environment, presenting hazards such as vacuum exposure and system malfunctions. Maintenance personnel perform Extravehicular Activities (EVA) here to ensure the integrity of the station’s gravity anchors and orbital stability.

## 🔊 Audio Logs
These lore-inspired audio logs add depth and atmosphere to each environment.  
Each log starts with an ID tag and timestamp to enhance immersion.

### ENG_DryDock

<details>
<summary>View ENG_DryDock Logs</summary>

> **Log ENG_DD_214. Recorded April 2nd, 2137.**  
DryDock’s full again. Two haulers in, one waiting in orbit. We’ve still got crates stacked three-deep. Cargo clamps keep locking out at random. I told command we needed a shutdown to reset the system, but they ignored me.

> **Log ENG_DD_218. Recorded April 4th, 2137.**  
A Working Joe overrode my airlock commands mid-cycle. Claimed cargo inspection from Core Control, but no log shows it. It vented the loader early — lost two crates. They’re not just assisting anymore, they’re taking over.

> **Log ENG_DD_221. Recorded April 7th, 2137.**  
We lost power to sector B last night. Emergency protocols kicked in but half the Joes were offline. I don’t trust those things anymore. They’ve been acting weird, like they have their own agenda.

> **Log ENG_DD_225. Recorded April 10th, 2137.**  
Security flagged an unauthorized access in the lower bay. No ID badge, no clearance. The cameras caught it — something moving too fast to be human. We locked down the section, but it vanished before we arrived.

### ENG_DryDockCargo

<summary>View ENG_DryDockCargo Logs</summary>

> **Log ENG_DDC_113. Recorded April 6th, 2137.**  
Inbound manifests from the Magellan claim we received med kits and fusion seals — but they’re not here. Either it’s an inventory error, or someone’s skimming cargo.

> **Log ENG_DDC_117. Recorded April 9th, 2137.**  
Cargo lift almost crushed a Joe. Breaker box overload again — upper deck keeps drawing from the same panel. If Engineering doesn’t reroute the power, someone’s going to die.

> **Log ENG_DDC_121. Recorded April 12th, 2137.**  
The Joes in Cargo are glitching again. Last week, one dropped a crate into the vacuum shaft. We found the logs scrubbed — whoever’s controlling them doesn’t want us to know.

> **Log ENG_DDC_125. Recorded April 15th, 2137.**  
Shipping schedules are off. Some cargo isn’t showing up on the manifests at all. I fear we’re being infiltrated from the inside. Trust no one.

</details>

### ENG_Gravity_Anchor

<details>
<summary>View ENG_Gravity_Anchor Logs</summary>

> **Log ENG_GA_031. Recorded March 5th, 2137.**  
Stabilizer Array 3 is out of sync. We’re drifting slightly off orbit. One more stabilizer goes out, and we lose nav sync for cargo runs. That’s our lifeline.

> **Log ENG_GA_036. Recorded March 7th, 2137.**  
Went EVA to check the clamps. Several were destroyed — melted or sliced. Not a micrometeoroid. Looked like chemical burns and scoring. I think… something else is out here.

> **Log ENG_GA_040. Recorded March 10th, 2137.**  
Radiation levels spiked near the east anchoring unit. Power fluctuations are affecting the thrusters. We’re patching it, but the system’s unstable. This can’t keep up much longer.

> **Log ENG_GA_045. Recorded March 14th, 2137.**  
A colleague disappeared during the last EVA. No distress call, no trace. The external cameras caught something drifting in space nearby — unidentifiable, fast-moving. We’re all on edge.
