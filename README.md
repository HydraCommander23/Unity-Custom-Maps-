# Custom Unity Maps for *Alien: Isolation*

![header](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a797edf-8836-4f99-b4a4-1fd938bd1aa3)

- This repo will contain my custom versions of unused or cut areas from Alien: Isolation, made in Unity 2022.3.9f1. The original game has many doors, elevators, and areas that you can't access — likely removed late in development. 
- My plan is to develop/recreate what the game might have played like if they were kept/added in. 


## 📂 Areas currently being envisoned 
### 🔧 ENG_DryDock/ENG_DryDockCargo
A conceptual drydock and maintenance bay for incoming freighters or engineering modules.
